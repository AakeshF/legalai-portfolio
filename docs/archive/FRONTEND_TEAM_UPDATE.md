# Frontend Team Update - Legal AI Backend Status

## 🚀 Backend Implementation Complete

The legal AI backend has been significantly enhanced with enterprise-grade security and compliance features. Here's what's new and ready for integration:

### 🔐 Core Security Features Implemented

1. **Secure AI Processing Pipeline**
   - Main endpoint: `POST /api/ai/integrated/process`
   - Automatically handles anonymization, consent checking, and security enforcement
   - Returns redacted responses with sensitive data protected

2. **Data Anonymization**
   - Automatic PII detection and redaction
   - Reversible anonymization for authorized users
   - Custom pattern configuration per organization

3. **Consent Management**
   - Check consent: `GET /api/consent/check`
   - Record consent: `POST /api/consent/record`
   - Required for processing sensitive data

4. **Admin Review Workflow**
   - Some prompts may require manual review
   - Real-time status updates via WebSocket: `/api/prompts/ws/{prompt_id}`
   - Users receive status updates when prompts are approved/rejected

### 📝 Key API Changes

#### New Main AI Endpoint
```javascript
POST /api/ai/integrated/process
{
    "prompt": "User's question here",
    "session_id": "optional-session-id",
    "document_ids": ["doc1", "doc2"],  // optional
    "preferred_model": "claude-3-sonnet",  // optional
    "context": {}  // optional
}

Response:
{
    "status": "success",
    "response": "AI response (sensitive data automatically redacted)",
    "metadata": {
        "prompt_id": 123,
        "model_used": "claude:claude-3-sonnet",
        "anonymization_applied": true,
        "classification": "confidential",
        "cost_estimate": 0.0125
    }
}
```

#### Status Codes to Handle
- **403 Forbidden**: Security policy blocked the request
- **402 Payment Required**: Consent required before processing
- **202 Accepted**: Request pending manual review

### 🎯 Frontend Integration Points

1. **Consent Flow**
   - Check if consent is required before sending prompts
   - Show consent dialog when `status: "consent_required"`
   - Submit consent via `/api/consent/record`

2. **Review Queue**
   - Handle `status: "pending_review"` responses
   - Show estimated wait time to users
   - Use WebSocket for real-time updates

3. **Security Indicators**
   - Display data classification level from metadata
   - Show when anonymization was applied
   - Indicate if response was redacted

4. **Session Management**
   - Create sessions: `POST /api/ai/integrated/session/create`
   - Maintain conversation context automatically

### 🔧 Configuration Needed

Frontend should allow users to:
- Set AI model preferences
- Configure anonymization rules (admin only)
- View compliance dashboard (admin only)
- Manage API keys (optional - backend has fallback)

### 📊 New Admin Features

For admin users, these new endpoints are available:
- `/api/prompts/admin/*` - Review queue management
- `/api/security/compliance/report` - Compliance reporting
- `/api/anonymization/patterns` - Configure detection patterns
- `/api/security/incidents` - View security incidents

### ⚡ Performance Notes

- Anonymization adds ~100-200ms to requests
- Review queue may delay responses (show progress indicators)
- WebSocket connections recommended for real-time updates
- Batch API available for multiple requests

### 🚨 Important Security Notes

1. **Never** send raw sensitive data - let backend handle detection
2. **Always** check consent status for new features
3. **Display** security warnings when high-risk data is detected
4. **Store** session IDs securely for conversation continuity

### 📞 Support

The backend is production-ready with:
- Comprehensive error messages
- Request tracking via prompt_id
- Detailed audit logs
- Health monitoring endpoints

For any integration issues, check:
- `/health` - System health
- `/api/ai/integrated/health` - AI components health
- Logs include request IDs for debugging

**Backend Status: ✅ Fully Operational**

All security features are active and monitoring is enabled. The system will automatically protect sensitive data while maintaining usability.
