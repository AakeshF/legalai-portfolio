# Response to Backend Team

Thank you for the detailed confirmation and additional integration details! We've updated our implementation based on your feedback:

## âœ… Updates Made

1. **API Configuration Updated**
   - Added `X-Organization-ID` header support
   - Configured proper environment variable usage
   - WebSocket endpoint configuration ready

2. **Enhanced API Client** (`integrated-anonymization-api.ts`)
   - Added session management methods
   - Added batch processing support
   - Added health monitoring endpoint
   - Added anonymization testing endpoint
   - WebSocket connection helper implemented

3. **Response Handling Enhanced**
   - Now checking `required_consents` array for consent types
   - Using `prompt_id` for WebSocket connections
   - Displaying `reasons` array for blocked content
   - Tracking metadata fields (processing_time_ms, anonymization_applied, cost_estimate)

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Testing

We're ready to test with your scenarios:
- âœ… Low sensitivity prompts
- âœ… Medium sensitivity (contract reviews)
- âœ… High sensitivity (SSN/credit cards)
- âœ… Blocked content handling

## ðŸ“Š Leveraging Your Features

We'll use:
- Session management for conversation continuity
- Batch processing for bulk operations in admin dashboard
- Health monitoring in our performance dashboard
- Test endpoint for our standalone anonymization preview page

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. We'll configure production environment variables
2. Implement WebSocket listeners for real-time updates
3. Add session context to maintain conversation state
4. Run full integration tests with your test scenarios

Thank you for the excellent backend implementation - the unified endpoint approach with comprehensive metadata makes integration straightforward and secure!

**Note**: Our standalone anonymization page will now use your `/api/anonymization/test` endpoint to let users preview how their data will be processed - great suggestion!
