## Conclusion

The Legal AI Frontend is in a strong position with core functionality complete and recent bug fixes improving the user experience. The application provides a solid foundation for legal document analysis with AI assistance. 

The recommended next steps focus on completing essential features, enhancing the AI capabilities, and preparing for enterprise deployment. With the proposed roadmap, we can deliver a production-ready application within 8-12 weeks that meets the needs of legal professionals while maintaining high standards for security and performance.

For immediate next steps, I recommend:
1. Implementing document download functionality
2. Adding search and filtering capabilities
3. Gathering user feedback from the demo deployment
4. Beginning work on the analytics dashboard

The frontend is ready for initial user testing, and we should start collecting feedback to inform our development priorities.
