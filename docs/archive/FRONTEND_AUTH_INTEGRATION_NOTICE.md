# Frontend Team: Auth Integration Notice

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** BLOCKED - Waiting for Backend Auth Fix

## Current Situation

The backend team is fixing critical security issues:
1. Removing hardcoded secrets from `backend/config.py`
2. Enabling authentication middleware
3. Implementing proper JWT token validation

## Your Preparation Tasks

While waiting for the backend fixes, prepare the following:

### 1. Token Management Service

Create `frontend/src/services/auth/token.service.ts`:
- Store refresh token in localStorage
- Keep access token in memory only
- Implement automatic token refresh
- Handle token expiration

### 2. API Client with Interceptors

Update `frontend/src/services/api/client.ts`:
- Add Authorization header to all requests
- Implement 401 response handling
- Auto-refresh tokens on 401
- Redirect to login on auth failure

### 3. Auth Context Setup

Create `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`:
- User state management
- Login/logout methods
- Protected route wrapper
- Persistent auth check

### 4. Update All API Calls

Review and update:
- Document service calls
- Chat API integration
- File upload handlers
- All fetch/axios calls to use new client

## Testing Checklist

Once backend is ready:
- [ ] Login flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Tokens are properly stored
- [ ] API calls include auth headers
- [ ] 401 triggers token refresh
- [ ] Logout clears all tokens
- [ ] Protected routes redirect when unauthenticated

## Coordination

The orchestrator will notify you when:
1. Backend secrets are removed
2. Auth middleware is enabled
3. Integration testing can begin

**Current Status:** Waiting for backend security fixes

**Next Steps:** Once notified, immediately test auth integration and report any issues.
