# Organization Data Scoping Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive organization-based data scoping for the Legal AI Backend. This ensures complete data isolation between different law firms using the platform.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Organization Middleware (`organization_middleware.py`)

Created a robust middleware system for automatic organization filtering:

- **OrganizationQueryFilter**: Automatically filters SQLAlchemy queries by organization_id
- **OrganizationSecurityLogger**: Logs all access attempts and security violations
- **OrganizationSecurityViolation**: Custom exception for cross-organization access attempts
- Helper functions for creating pre-filtered queries

### 2. Updated Document Endpoints

All document endpoints now include organization filtering:

- **POST /api/documents/upload**: Automatically sets organization_id from authenticated user
- **GET /api/documents**: Filters results by organization_id
- **GET /api/documents/{id}**: Verifies ownership before returning
- **DELETE /api/documents/{id}**: Verifies ownership before deleting
- **POST /api/documents/{id}/reprocess**: Includes organization verification
- **POST /api/documents/search**: Organization-scoped search

Security logging added for unauthorized access attempts.

### 3. Updated Chat Endpoints

Chat functionality is now organization-scoped:

- **POST /api/chat**: Creates sessions linked to organization, only accesses org's documents
- **GET /api/chat/{session_id}/history**: Verifies session belongs to organization

### 4. Background Processing Updates

Document processing now respects organization boundaries:

- Background tasks receive organization_id parameter
- Processing functions verify organization ownership before updates
- Error handling maintains organization context

### 5. Organization Management Endpoints (`organization_routes.py`)

New admin-only endpoints for organization management:

- **GET /api/organization**: Get current organization details
- **PUT /api/organization**: Update organization settings (admin only)
- **GET /api/organization/users**: List all organization users (admin only)
- **POST /api/organization/invite**: Invite new users (admin only)
- **DELETE /api/organization/users/{user_id}**: Remove users (admin only)
- **PUT /api/organization/users/{user_id}/role**: Update user roles (admin only)

### 6. Security Features

- All endpoints verify organization ownership before data access
- Cross-organization access attempts are logged
- Admin role required for organization management
- Prevents removing the last admin user
- Soft delete for user removal

### 7. Schema Updates

Added new Pydantic schemas:
- `OrganizationUpdate`: For updating organization details
- `UserInvite`: For inviting new users
- `OrganizationUsersResponse`: For listing organization users
- Enhanced `OrganizationResponse` with usage metrics

### 8. Logging Improvements

- Replaced print statements with structured logging
- Added organization context to all log entries
- Security events logged separately for audit trails

## Testing

Created `test_organization_scoping.py` to verify:
1. Organization registration and isolation
2. Document access restrictions
3. Cross-organization access prevention
4. Chat session isolation
5. Organization management endpoints
6. User invitation and management

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Isolation**: All queries automatically filtered by organization_id
2. **Access Logging**: All cross-organization attempts logged for security audits
3. **Role-Based Access**: Admin functions restricted to admin users only
4. **Ownership Verification**: All resource access verified against organization
5. **Fail-Safe Design**: Default behavior denies access unless explicitly allowed

## Usage Examples

### Document Upload (Automatic Org Assignment)
```python
# User's organization is automatically applied
POST /api/documents/upload
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### List Documents (Org-Filtered)
```python
# Only returns documents from user's organization
GET /api/documents
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Invite New User (Admin Only)
```python
POST /api/organization/invite
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
{
    "email": "[email@example.com]",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "role": "attorney"
}
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Start the server
python start.py

# Run organization scoping tests
python test_organization_scoping.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Add organization-based usage quotas
2. Implement organization-level settings for AI features
3. Add billing integration per organization
4. Create organization activity audit logs
5. Add data export functionality per organization
